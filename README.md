# **Python-Antivirus-v2**
A simple antivirus coded in python capable of scanning selected files and deleting files that it detects as infected. This antivirus uses a large list of MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 malware hashes (many of which coming from this repo - https://github.com/Len-Stevens/MD5-Malware-Hashes) to determine infections. However as this project progresses I would like to implement machine learning detection with the long term goal of becoming a fully functioning antivirus. 

Thank You! :)

## NOTE:
After installing all the packages if the imports show any error .Create a virtual environment with new packages installed and run the script though the virtual environment. 

eicar.com file uploaded with the rest of the document is a malware which will help predict the functioning of the antivirus
